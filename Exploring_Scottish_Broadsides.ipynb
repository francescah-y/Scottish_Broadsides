    "### About the *Scottish Broadsides 1650-1910* Dataset\n",
    "Broadsides are single sheet items printed on one side only; they were designed to be read unfolded and posted up in public places. They were originally used for the printing of royal proclamations, acts, and official notices. From the second half of the 17th century onwards they became a format widely used for political agitation and were an essential part of printed popular culture, reporting on current hot topics of conversation and scandalous events, such as: violent crimes, the trial and scaffold speeches of convicted criminals, prize fights, mysterious apparitions etc. They also reproduced the words of popular ballads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset comprises nearly 1,800 broadsides printed in Scotland. They have been acquired by the National Library since 1925; many of them form part of the Lauriston Castle Collection, which was bequeathed to the Library in 1926.\n",

For example, to study the vocabulary of a text, it's useful to remove punctuation and digits, lowercase the remaining alphabetic words, and then reduce those words to their root form (with stemming or lemmatisation - more on this later).  Alternatively, to identify people and places using named entity recognition, it's important to keep capitalisation in words and keep words in the context of their sentences."

    "Great, we have successfully created the metadata dataframe, however, looking at the dataframe we can see that it will need some cleaning. It is important to note that many of the columns exist in multiple, such as **person1**...**person4**. This is as a result of some fo the Broadsides having multiple people mentioned in the file. However, because most of the Broadsides don't have this information extracted these columns will be empty. The empty cells contain the value `NaN`, meaning *'not a number'*. This is an issue as `NaN` is in fact a *float* (a **float** is a value type for decimals in Python, due to the 'floating' decimal point). As the rest of the values in the respective columns are *strings*, when we are iterating through these columns the code is going to produce an error when it comes across these *float* values.\n",

We will then lowercase all the tokens so that those that are capitalised are not recognised as different words to those in lowercase:"

This will count up the number of times each unique value occurs and add it to a histogram. However, count plot requires the value type to be a *string* not and *int*. Therefore, we have to convert the data type of the **date_issued** back to strings.\n",

    "The benefits of the `countplot` is that it again gives us very specific data about each year. It also tells us that quite a lot of the Broadsides don't have a **date_issued** value. On the other hand, this is not the easiest graph to look at. The graph has to be tall to be able to see all the individual years, but its height means we cannot see the whole graph at once, making it hard to draw comparisons between different years. The individual bars also make it harder to see trends throughout the years.\n",

    "The `displot` puts the years into 'bins', meaning each bar on the graph represents a collection of 5 years. This makes it easier to look at as we can see the entire graph at once and allows addition of a trend line so we can see how the number of Broadsides published changed over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more useful interpretation of the data. From the previous visualisation we saw that the year 1880 had the greatest number of Broadsides published, despite this being true, this plots shows us that the time period around 1880 **was not** actually the peak of the publications. This graph instead shows that *cumulatively*, the years around 1825 **was** the peak of the Broadsides publications.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, we have an idea for the trends within each column in the metadata, now we can dive a little deeper and take a look at the potential relationship *between* the different variables. For example, we can combine the **place** metadata with the **date_issued** metadata to see whether the publishing locations changed over time.\n",

    "Finally, it would be good to look at how the locations mentioned in the Broadsides titles change over time, and then we can see how similar this is to the publishing locations. To do this we need to **merge** the *title_locations* dataframe with the *metadata* dataframe, so that we can associate the lcoations with the years issued. To do this we use `pd.merge` with the parameter `how='left'` - this means that it will merge using only the keys from the `left` dataframe and will therefore only contain the file IDs that had a location mentioned in their title:"

    "My first hypothesis is that there is a large amount of data missing from *The Broadsides* dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a major gap in the number of Broadsides in the dataset published between approximately 1730 and 1790 as shown in [5.4 Dates of Broadsides publication](#5.4-Dates-of-Broadsides-publication). This could potentially be due to the Jacobite rising of 1745 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_rising_of_1745), a major historical event at the time, but I don't think this could explain a gap of 60 years. I think it is mrore likely that our dataset is merely a sample of the Broadsides that existed at the time.\n",

    "We could ask the National Library of Scotland whether they have a figure for the approximate number of Broadsides that would've been published during this period to get an idea of the sample size of our dataset."

    "\n",
    "My second hypothesis is that the **text** locations would vary over time, and that they would correlate with the **title** locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this because locations were mentioned when a story or event of interest happened there. So although places like Edinburgh and Glasgow would be mentioned quite consistently over time, I think that you would see spikes over time when looking at places that are mentioned more infrequently. This might happen for example when there are a series of Broadsides published consecutively about the same event or news story.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to look at the locations mentioned in the text of each fileid, and plot these over time with the corresponding metadata we would be able to see these trends. To do this I would need to adjust the method I used above to find the locations in the text, so that these could also be associated with the appropriate file ID."

    "My final hypothesis is that there is a correlation between the place that a Broadside was published, and the location mentioned in both the **title** and the **text**.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final two catplots show similar trends when looking at the places that Broadsides were published and the locations mentioned in the titles, over time. This might be because at the time communities were a lot mroe localised. Therefore, the news that they were interested in would be more localised and the Broadsides published in a particular area would therefore be telling stories about events in that same area. Additionally, journalists in a particular lcoation would be writing about the places they lived in.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this hypothesis I would need to plot both variable onto the same graph, such as a heatmap, to see if there is a correlation. I could also combine this with the locations mentioned in text over time, once I have extracted and combined this data."

    "This experience has taught me a great deal about the different ways you can explore data. Initially, I found it difficult to think about the text files themselves as the **dataset** rather than thinking about the metadata as the dataset. This opportunity has allowed me to develop skills in Natural Language Processing as well as develop my ability to think of different questions we can ask about a dataset. I have improved by ability to write functions and create for loops, and test these using assertions where appropriate. I am impressed by how much my coding skills have progressed over the past 2 months."
